# MEGA Cells: Extras

With the main premise of the add-on addressed, we now conclude with some of the smaller extra features and additions
provided by MEGA for the sake of both completeness and a bit more experimentation.

## MEGA Interface

  <ItemImage id="mega_interface" scale="3" />
  <ItemImage id="cable_mega_interface" scale="3" />
</Row>

As a complement to the <ItemLink id="megacells:mega_pattern_provider" />, the **MEGA Interface** serves as a
double-capacity version of the <ItemLink id="ae2:interface" />. Twice the slots, twice the I/O and throughput, and twice
the stock-keeping.

## Portable Cell Workbench

<ItemImage id="portable_cell_workbench" scale="2" />

Somewhat out of character for the rest of the add-on, the **Portable Cell Workbench** is a... *smaller* version of
the <ItemLink id="ae2:cell_workbench" />. Small enough, in fact, to fit just in the palm of your hand, while still
capable of configuring any storage cell as normal.

One can only wonder how a whole workbench could have fit into this thing.

## Cell Dock

(TODO: Add game scene instead with a cell inside a dock)
<ItemImage id="cell_dock" scale="2" />

Finally, we have something else that's once again smaller rather than larger, which is why it seemed more out-of-place
than anything to call it a "MEGA" item.

The **ME Cell Dock** is, in some ways, like a more compact version of the <ItemLink id="ae2:chest" />. While it may lack
some of the extra functionality of the Chest — namely, its built-in terminal — it still makes for a fine compact storage
provider, particularly since it fits the same as a flat [cable part](ae2:ae2-mechanics/cable-subparts.md). Perhaps one
may find it useful in the case of a compact subnetwork requiring some kind of temporary/buffer storage.
