# MEGA Cells: Energy

## Superdense Energy Cell

<ItemImage id="mega_energy_cell" scale="3" />

It would be remiss, of course, for MEGA to not also provide a larger
[Energy Cell](ae2:items-blocks-machines/energy_cells.md), so thankfully that base is also covered here.

The *Superdense Energy Cell* holds 8 times as much energy as a Dense Energy Cell, for a total of up to 12.8 *million* AE
per cell. Perfect for those especially large [Spatial IO](ae2:ae2-mechanics/spatial-io.md) setups and transfer
operations requiring an immense energy buffer, now in a more compact block space!

## Greater Energy Card

<ItemImage id="greater_energy_card" scale="3" />

Further still, the Superdense Energy Cell can be used to craft a more souped up version of the
[Energy Card](ae2:items-blocks-machines/upgrade_cards.md), providing an even greater energy buffer to any wireless
infrastructure such as portable storage cells and [wireless terminals](ae2:items-blocks-machines/wireless_terminals.md).
AE2's own such devices will support it just as well as the regular Energy Card, however, as the regular Energy Card
isn't *quite* strong enough for the more demanding MEGA portable cells, these will support *only* the Greater Energy
Card to increase their battery capacity with.
