## ![About][header_about]
MEGA Cells is an add-on for [Applied Energistics 2][ae2] providing higher tiers of storage, ranging in capacity from 1M to as high as 256M, similarly to add-ons of old such as Extra Cells 2 and its successors.

Unlike conventional add-ons in the same vein, MEGA does things quite differently, featuring its own dedicated progression line and components to further augment and challenge existing AE2 players' set-ups, while emphasising a distinct visual style with jet-black colour schemes.

## ![Features][header_features]
- **1M - 256M** item and fluid cells (standard + portable)
- MEGA **Crafting CPUs** with bespoke all-black crafting units: 1M - 256M storage, 4-threaded co-processing unit and matching monitor
- Integration with multiple other AE2 add-ons such as [Applied Mekanistics][appmek] (1-256M chemical cells) and [Applied Botanics][appbot] (1-256M mana cells)
- **MEGA Bulk Item Storage Cell**: Designed for infinite storage of a single item type
- **Bulk Compression**: Automatic conversion between ingots, nuggets and blocks for bulk item cell storage, with full support for auto-crafting via the **Decompression Module**
- **MEGA Pattern Provider**: Double-capacity storage for processing patterns
- **Superdense Energy Cell** and **Greater Energy Card**: Increased energy storage for AE networks and portable devices

...and more still to come.
